        I contributed to the <a href="http://www.gtkmm.org">gtkmm project</a>,
        C++ bindings for <a href="http://www.gtk.org">Gtk+</a> and related open source
        libraries, between 2006 and 2008. I was fortunate to collaborate with some
        very smart and hard working developers and learned a lot from them. My biggest
        contributions were bindings, documentation and example programs for the Gtk+
        printing API and Glibâ€™s GIO.
