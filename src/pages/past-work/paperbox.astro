    <section>
      <p>Paperbox was a document browser for GNOME desktop.</p>

      <p>
        I wanted to create an interface which would show all documents a user
        has on her computer, let her organize them by system-wide tags and
        ultimately eliminate the concept of files. This is essentially how
        mobile apps work in 2010s. It relied on <a
          href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Tracker">Tracker</a
        >, a desktop search engine and metadata store.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked on it during 2007 and showed a live demo during a lightning
        talk at Guadec 2008 in Istanbul.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's the initial project proposal, as published on my blog on March 4,
        2007.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Here I will lay out an idea I&#8217;ve had in my head for a while,
          about a program for browsing and organizing documents with categories
          and tags, which retrieves and stores metadata in <a
            href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/tracker">Tracker</a
          >. My intention is to propose it in a few weeks as a Summer of Code
          project. However, since it attempts to change things on the desktop a
          little bit, I&#8217;d like to first hear opinions from the <span
            class="caps">GNOME</span
          > community and developers about the idea in general (and in specifics).
        </p>

        <p><strong>Introducing&#8230;</strong></p>

        <p>
          The idea is to provide make a step forward in the way a user views and
          organizes her documents, and provide a way which is more natural to
          our minds than the generic file/directory view. For example, when
          locating a certain document, a user would not need to recall one of
          numerous file paths, but would follow a map of terms she defined in
          easily understandable words and expressions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently this is possible using metadata, and Tracker specifically.
          While one may argue that it is possible to achieve this effect by
          having some default desktop-wide places, ie bookmarked directories,
          and then having the user name and structure files and directories with
          discipline, this is simply put not good enough, and things could be
          better. For instance, if you have a document&#8217;s title, it&#8217;s
          file path doesn&#8217;t really matter. Actually, even that it is a
          file (as if a &#8220;file&#8221; is something real anyway) stored in a
          certain directory would not necessarily need to be known! And tags are
          already a proven method for categorizing data, used and well
          understood by a large number of people on the Internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          So note that this program would not offer some huge functionality,
          lots of options to &#8220;explore&#8221; etc; it serves the aim to
          bring the computer desktop a bit closer to our perception of the
          world.
        </p>

        <p>Here&#8217;s an initial mockup:</p>

        <p>
          <a href={paperbox.src}
            ><img
              src={paperbox.src}
              alt="Initial Paperbox mockup"
              width="400"
            /></a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          The main means of organizing and browsing data are user defined
          categories and tags.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Categories</strong></p>

        <p>A category is defined with:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            An emblem, <a
              href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards_2fdesktop_2demblem_2dspec"
              >as proposed at f.d.o.</a
            >, which includes a tag and an associated icon,
          </li>

          <li>
            A number of tags which all contained documents should have, and
          </li>

          <li>A number of parameters, which shape the category.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Parameters may include a list of <span class="caps">MIME</span>
          types to consider, and a combination of <a
            href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards/shared-filemetadata-spec"
            >generic file and document metadata</a
          >. A category making dialog should provide an easy way to specify
          them. For example, it could offer ready combo boxes, similar to the
          original Gnome file search dialog. The data entered would then serve
          to store <span class="caps">RDF</span> queries, which the program runs
          on demand.
        </p>

        <p>
          A category may contain other categories. Browsing a category would
          activate a &#8220;tag cloud&#8221; showing all tags attached to the
          documents inside it. Selecting a document would update a lower tile
          showing relevant metadata. This tile would be customizable, and it
          would replace the current approach in file managers of showing a
          number of columns which, in my experience, never fit on the screen. So
          there would be only one column; it&#8217;s probably best for it to
          display file names by default, however it could be customizable for
          each category and it would be natural to expect a move towards
          displaying document titles.
        </p>

        <p><strong>!(Nautilus integration)</strong></p>

        <p>
          Here&#8217;s why I think this should <em>not</em> be integrated in Nautilus.
          First of all, Nautilus is a general purpose file browser. The functionality
          proposed here offers a higher level abstraction in
          <span class="caps">HCI</span>, and does not intend to cover all file
          types, but instead focuses solely on documents. Adding it as a new
          kind of a &#8220;view&#8221; in Nautilus would lead to a requirement
          to cover music, video and images as well. This is not the point. There
          are already many good media players and photo/image browsers. They
          should take care of that (or their) part of, strictly speaking, file
          and <span class="caps">MIME</span> type-specific management and presentation.
          One could say that there could be separate &#8220;views&#8221;. Yes, but
          not bundled in a single program. And lastly, Tracker is still not an official
          <span class="caps">GNOME</span> dependancy.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is of course not to say that Nautilus should not have it&#8217;s
          own metadata tile and tagging mechanism, which is happily
          <a href="http://njpatel.blogspot.com/2007/03/hi-pgo.html"
            >already under development</a
          >.
        </p>

      <p>
        I released the first version of Paperbox on <a
          href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnome.announce/5989"
          >November 6, 2007</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's a screencast of the program below, showing its main features.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was very interested in new types of GUI elements at that time, such as
        those made on a 2D or 3D canvas (such as Clutter). The tag cloud is
        implemented with a canvas library called goocanvas.

      <p>
        Last version of Paperbox is 0.4.4, released on <a
          href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2009-October/msg00037.html"
          >October 19, 2009</a
        >. Paperbox is <a href="https://github.com/GNOME/paperbox"
          >available on GitHub</a
        >
        under the GPL 2 license.
