Chris Dixon wrote a [nice and concise article](http://cdixon.org/2011/02/21/the-importance-of-predictability-for-platform-developers/) on the economics of software platforms, which reflect how seasoned software developers approach them.

The final paragraph explains, in a nutshell, the core reasons why we've based our company on open platforms:

> The least risky platforms to develop on are successful open platforms like the web, email, and Linux. These platforms tend to change slowly and have very public development roadmaps. In the rare case where a technology is subsumed by an open platform, it is usually apparent far in advance. [...] The predictability of open platforms is the main reason that vast amounts of wealth have been created on top of them and investment around them continues unabated.
