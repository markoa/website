We're hosting a virtual Semaphore Summit on February 26-28 to kick off [our open source journey](/signals/semaphore-going-open-source).

Each session is short and focused: Darko, our CTO, will open the Summit with a keynote on why we made this move and what it means for the future of CI/CD. Other engineers will share tips on running Semaphore and optimizing CI/CD workflows. We're also excited to host developers from companies like Confluent and SimplePractice sharing their experiences.

The event is free to attend and the sessions will take place during NYC noon time. The best part is that every talk will have a live Q&A session. So no long dull videos, just real conversations about continuous delivery.
