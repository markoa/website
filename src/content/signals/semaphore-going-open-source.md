After more than a decade of building Semaphore as a commercial CI/CD platform, we're open sourcing the entire core under Apache 2.0. This is a moment I've been waiting for for a long time. The stars have finally aligned — the tools for self-hosting cloud native applications have matured, developer tools have found their natural home in open source, and we've built something worth sharing with the world.

What excites me most isn't just opening up our codebase — it's the transformation into building in public. The best developer tools are built in the open, shaped by the collective wisdom of their users. It's time for Semaphore to join that tradition.

Update: we're kicking off our open source journey during the [Semaphore Summit](/signals/semaphore-summit-2025) on February 26th.
