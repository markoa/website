Ben Horowitz in [A Good Place to Work](http://bhorowitz.com/2012/08/18/a-good-place-to-work)

> In good organizations, people can focus on their work and have confidence that if they get their work done, good things will happen for both the company and them personally. [...] In a poor organization, on the other hand, people spend much of their time fighting organizational boundaries, infighting and broken processes.

It may sound like a large company's problem, but it can also be a small group's problem. A group of people is not a team, and making a functional team is a lot of work.
