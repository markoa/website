As [announced](/signals/semaphore-going-open-source), Semaphore has open sourced its CI/CD platform under Apache 2.0 in a new GitHub repository: [semaphoreio/semaphore](https://github.com/semaphoreio/semaphore).

Here's what you can do with it:

- Star the repo as a way to support us (2 seconds)
- [Self-host](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/CE/getting-started/install) a webscale CI/CD platform (less than 30 minutes)
- Contribute to the codebase and help make it even better (infinite fun)

We also have a new website domain: [semaphore.io](https://semaphore.io).

This is the biggest news we've released since [launching Semaphore 2.0](https://semaphore.io/blog/2018/07/25/semaphore-2-0.html) in 2018. We're super excited to continue building the best CI/CD platform in the world with the community. Marathon, not a sprint.
