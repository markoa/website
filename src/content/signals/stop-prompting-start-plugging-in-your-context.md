If you're still using AI by writing prompts, you're missing 80% of the value.

The real gains are made when you give models access to your context: your docs, your tickets, your code, your metrics, and your decisions.

Which leads to a fundamental truth: **AI is an amplifier of what you already have in your organization.**

That's the good news and the bad news.

If your company playbook is stale, AI will confidently repeat outdated information.

If your decisions aren't recorded, AI will "align" people around fiction.

If your engineering team isn't doing continuous delivery with fast CI, frequent deploys, and easy rollbacks, AI will generate more code than you can responsibly move into production.

The greatest returns come from investing in the foundations: your data, your platform, your engineering discipline, and your feedback loops with users.

The good news is that the amplifier works both ways.

When AI gives you a bad answer, it's rarely an AI problem. It's a spotlight on what needs to become explicit, searchable, and true. Fix that, feed it back into the system, and the next answer gets better, along with everything else.
