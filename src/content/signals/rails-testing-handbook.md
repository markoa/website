At Rendered Text and Semaphore, we have a long history with Ruby on Rails. Checking the [blog archive](https://renderedtext.com/blog/archive) reminds me that we published first posts about working with Rails way back in 2009.

Many years and thousands of lines of code later, I’m proud to announce that we’ve published our first ebook. It’s called [Rails Testing Handbook](https://semaphore.io/ebooks/rails-testing-handbook) and it distills the essence of building Rails apps with tests, doing continuous integration and collaborating via pull requests. It’s the workflow which has served us well over the years, most notably in creating and scaling [Semaphore](https://semaphore.io) without losing our minds.

Early reader feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Some lead developers have shared that they got a few new tricks from it. Newcomers said that the book has helped them finally understand behavior-driven development (BDD).

So if you’re working with Rails, I encourage you to [download the book](https://semaphore.io/ebooks/rails-testing-handbook) — it’s free! — check it out, share it with your friends and send us any feedback you may have. Enjoy!
