_You can just do things_ is the best startup meme in a long time.

Action produces information. When you do things it makes things happen. Or not.

Doing things shows you things you didn't know. Motion creates clarity. So you can learn things to do more of the right things and less of the wrong things.

The world doesn't belong to people who keep planning things because they rarely accomplish things.

It certainly doesn't belong to people who have opinions about things.

The world belongs to those who do things.
