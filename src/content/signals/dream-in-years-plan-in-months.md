[DJ Patil, former U.S. Chief Data Scientist](https://medium.com/@dpatil/class-of-2020-from-one-data-scientist-to-another-f3de5f2d70d) kept this as a daily reminder card:

> Dream in years <br/>
> Plan in months <br/>
> Evaluate in weeks <br/>
> Ship daily <br/> <br/>
> Prototype for 1x <br/>
> Build for 10x <br/>
> Engineer for 100x <br/> <br/>
> Whatâ€™s required to cut the timeline in half? <br/>
> What needs to be done to double the impact?
