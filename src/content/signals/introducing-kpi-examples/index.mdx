### Does the world really need a website about KPIs?

It's a common adage: You can't manage what you don't measure. A proven method for efficiently getting things done is by assigning each team member a specific metric for accountability.

A few years back, while establishing new departments at [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com) in areas I wasn't familiar with, my initial step was often hunting for a comprehensive list of KPIs for that specific function. Because a robust KPI list essentially outlines what excellence looks like in that domain.

In that job, I kept returning to kpilibrary.com—a comprehensive crowdsourced database that, regrettably, is no longer online. Nowadays, if you search for example KPIs, much of what surfaces is content that lacks depth—aimed more at SEO or product promotion rather than providing clear-cut insights.

### KPI Examples is open source and a work in progress

We want the content we publish—especially since KPI Examples is [open for contribution](https://kpiexamples.operately.com/contribute)—to be around for a long time. That's why the website is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/operately/kpiexamples), and the KPI database itself is [a public Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17rw8FVoOh9jKP6HGZARI5ba7EXTp-x3xBbWcOtoW0vs).

You'll observe that some categories on the site are currently empty; however, you can leave your email to be notified once they're populated. We're committed to expanding the database of KPIs and categories on a weekly basis.
