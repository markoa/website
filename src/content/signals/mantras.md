Therapy is expensive but saying this is free:

Ship it.<br/>
Fail fast.<br/>
Just do it.<br/>
Locked in.<br/>
Skill issue.<br/>
It's always day one.<br/>
You can just do things.<br/>
Fuck around and find out.<br/>
Move fast and break things.<br/>
Done is better than perfect.<br/>
Discipline equals freedom.<br/>
Don't ask for permission.<br/>
Open source everything.<br/>
Fuck it we ball.<br/>
Zero to one.<br/>
Amp it up.<br/>
Don't die.<br/>
Kaizen.<br/>
LFG.
