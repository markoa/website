We just dropped [Operately v0.1](https://operately.com/releases/release-v010/). You can [install it in 5 minutes](https://operately.com/install/) on a cheap cloud server.

This release marks a significant milestone for us: it's the first time users can install and run Operately on their own servers, bringing our open-source commitment to life.

> _**Wait, I thought you guys are building a SaaS?!**_

We are! But we're also dead serious about open-source. Self-hosting needs to be easy and cheap from day one.

Our north star is **WordPress-level simplicity for business software**.

SaaS is in our DNA, self-hosting isn't. So if we don't nail self-hosting now, we never will.

> _**OK, makes sense. What's in the release?**_

Operately v0.1 is your company's command center that unifies goals, projects, activities, and areas of ownership.

Soon. [Join the waitlist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebV6j1nIvyjvyLptZ95mHXoj42XrnBmd5znVnUzU_6ATAJgw/viewform) to be first in line.

### Behind the scenes

It took us 2 months to ship v0.1 after deciding we were ready. There's always a slew of not-so-fun stuff to take care of the first time. To give you an idea, here's the brief from our development project:

Shipping builds momentum. It's not new to us but the feeling is exhilarating and never gets old. We're committing to monthly releases of self-hostable Operately and continuous updates once we launch the SaaS.

We want to bridge the gap between open source flexibility and SaaS convenience. Stay tuned for what's next.
