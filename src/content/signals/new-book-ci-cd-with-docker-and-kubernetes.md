A gift for you: a free, 90-page ebook to learn CI/CD with Docker and Kubernetes. The book is [open source](https://github.com/semaphoreci/book-cicd-docker-kubernetes), and you can [download it today](https://semaphore.io/resources/cicd-docker-kubernetes).

### Why we wrote this book

Containers have become the standard executable format for cloud applications. But, changing how you build, test, and deploy code is a big deal for any engineering team.

Semaphore has been around since 2012, and our Customer Success team has worked with hundreds of organizations as they moved to a container-based architecture. Many more are yet to migrate.

We’ve seen it time and time again: adopting containers takes time.

There are many moving parts, and it’s not clear how to make the timeless practice of [Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)](/ci-cd-continuous-integration-delivery-explained) more productive, not less.

Eventually, it does get easier to onboard new team members, run tests reliably, be cloud-agnostic, and build new services. But to get there, you have to build internal know-how from several books and dozens of blog posts.

We wrote this book to help you build reliable and fast CI/CD pipelines for containers — in days, not weeks or months.

### Who is it for

We believe the book will be useful to:

- Senior developers who are beginning their journey into microservices or cloud-native architecture, or need to migrate an existing system to Kubernetes.
- CTOs and Directors of Engineering who need a clear vision of what a reliable, high-velocity CI/CD pipeline looks like and what it takes to build one.

### Download it today

I want to thank the book co-authors:

- [Jerome Petazzoni](https://x.com/jpetazzo), a leading instructor on containers, creator of [container.training](https://container.training/), and a former Docker core engineer.
- [Tomas Fernandez](https://x.com/tomfernblog), whom you might already know from Semaphore blog as an author of [highly valuable CI/CD tutorials](https://semaphore.io/author/tfernandez).

We combined our knowledge in CI/CD and containers to bring you a practical guide to shipping high-quality cloud apps rapidly and consistently.
