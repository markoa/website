A historical perspective on the evolution of software by Mike Swanson:

> What if your car worked like so many apps? You’re driving somewhere important…maybe running a little bit late. A few minutes into the drive, your car pulls over to the side of the road and asks:
>
> “How are you enjoying your drive so far?”
>
> Annoyed by the interruption, and even more behind schedule, you dismiss the prompt and merge back into traffic.
>
> A minute later it does it again.
>
> “Did you know I have a new feature? Tap here to learn more.” [...]
>
> I’ve started to think of this as backseat software: the slow shift from software as a tool you operate to software as a channel that operates on you.

It's a long post but worth reading in its entirety.

Key points I want to remember:

- When software collects data and sends updates, usage analytics (DAU, funnels, etc.) can become central to product decisions. The focus then shifts from helping users achieve goals to optimizing engagement metrics.
- Metrics can be correct but still mislead you. For example, a feature seems unused because it was badly designed and buried in the UI, not because it isn’t valuable.
- Testing can produce insights but also turns products into continuous experiments on users, where decisions favor what moves metrics fastest, not necessarily what aligns with product vision.

The paradox is that this approach is practiced at companies who _believe_ that this is what they should be doing to be successful. But the visionaries who built enduring companies kept their focus on the users.

Steve Jobs:

> You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology — not the other way around.

Jeff Bezos:

> We start with the customer and work backwards.

So instead of backseat software, we should build frontseat software. Software that stays out of your way, helps you finish the job, and shuts up when it’s done.
