[Naval Ravikant on X](https://x.com/naval/status/1875298113403150591):

> AI won't replace programmers, but rather make it easier for programmers to replace everyone else.

Someone jumps in with the "but Jensen Huang says AI writes code!" argument. Naval's response packs as much wit and insight per character as ever:

> Calculators can do math per CEO of Texas Instruments.

Exactly. Now is the best time in history to be a programmer.

AI expands your capabilities into domains where your knowledge was insufficient. If all you ever wanted was to create, and you're looking at AI the right way, chances are you feel reborn.

Designers who dreamed of breaking new ground in human-computer interaction but got stuck styling forms and churning out YouTube thumbnails should be excited.

The industry is resetting to where it was 18 years ago, before iPhone and when "social" web was just emerging. The soul-crushing parts of the job are being automated away. What's left? The work that actually matters: original thinking backed with good taste.

Technology creates demand for more technology. There will always be new programs to write.
