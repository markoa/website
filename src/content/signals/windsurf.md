I haven't hit "subscribe" this quickly in ages. While I've been using Claude and its artifacts as my programming sidekick for months, Windsurf editor takes the AI coding experience to new heights.

What makes it stand out:

- Full codebase awareness with ability to mention specific files and folders
- Direct command execution
- Intelligent reasoning about manual (is this how we will call it now?) code changes
- Seamless multi-file workflows

My number one advice to anyone struggling to get results from products like this: you need to improve at explaining what you mean.
