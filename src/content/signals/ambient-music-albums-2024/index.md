Ambient music is my workday companion. The albums collected here — ranging from spectral drones to late-night meditative jazz to minimalist classical pieces — have a peculiar effect: they help me carve out a space where focus is sustained and time seems to suspend itself. These are the records that have colored my working hours throughout 2024.
