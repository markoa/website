> If you do something, your business will do something.

The quote from Thomas Fuchs, one of the organizers of the awesome [SchnitzelConf](http://schnitzelconf.com/) in Vienna, is not quite epic (less than a dinner with dinosaurs at least) but it really is the basic assumption of success: keep moving.

The point of the conference was to encourage European web developers with an entrepreneurial spirit to build a product, charge for it and be independent. Definitely a good thing, as in the slightly socialist Europe the system usually trains people to look for "safer" opportunities.

The talks were fantastic, as the speakers were very open and shared a lot from their experience. They all spoke with a a slightly different focus but with the same background – that of a tech person with creativity, curiosity and individualism that could not be idle, to paraphrase Michael Buffington.

Andy Croll wrote a very nice [overview](http://nakedstartup.com/2010/09/schnitzelconf-an-overview/), and has documented the [presentations](http://nakedstartup.com/2010/09/schnitzelconf-presentations/) as well. Jarkko Laine's [mind maps](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/sets/72157624789944063/show/) are a good reminder in handwritten form. Buffington had a [slide](http://twitpic.com/2mu5m8) with random interesting quotes that he heard before his talk.
