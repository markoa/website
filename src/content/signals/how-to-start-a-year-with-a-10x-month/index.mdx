Let's start with something simple. Sketch out your goals for this year or maybe just the next six months.

Now, challenge yourself: **how could you accomplish all of it in just one month?**

Let's be clear, though. It's not about burning yourself out with an impossible todo list. There are only so many projects you can handle at once, and sure, some things inherently take time. But what if you pushed the boundaries... just a bit?

Give it a shot. Craft three pieces of content, even if they're not perfect, before lunchtime. That job description you're mulling over for next week? Finish it today. Planning to reach out to prospects "later in Q1"? Send emails to two people right now; the perfect CRM and a comprehensive playbook can wait.

You might just be surprised by the results.

At the very least, you'll be energized by the momentum you've created. This energy is contagious and your colleagues are likely to catch the vibe. You'll realize that many roadblocks are internal, not external. And once you start, you won't want to stop.

There are enough voices out there telling you what can't be done. Psyop yourself for a change. Shake things up. You might be amazed at where you end up.
