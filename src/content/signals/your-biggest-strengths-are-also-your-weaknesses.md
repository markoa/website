During a recent indie founders' meet-up, one question sparked a lively discussion: "_What are your biggest weaknesses as a founder that are holding you back?_". The common thread that emerged had little to do with gaps in skill, knowledge, or drive. **It was about our inherent belief that we, as founders, could do everything ourselves**.

Now, let's unpack that a bit. Founders are known for their ability to wear multiple hats. They're often polymaths, possessing the knack to navigate the early days from idea to launch—handling everything from coding to sales, from fundraising to customer support.

But, as the company grows, the founder's role needs to pivot too. They must transition from being the jack-of-all-trades to leading a team, and later, an entire organization.

Here's the catch: when circumstances change, our biggest strengths can quickly become our biggest weaknesses.

The world-class expertise that got the company off the ground can become a hindrance in hiring someone else to take over. It may be tough for first-time founders to realize that 80% quality delivered by an autonomous, fault-tolerant team is far better than a distracted genius's scattered efforts.

If you're highly independent and self-sufficient, you may find it challenging to delegate, causing burnout and opportunity cost before finally making the leap. Similarly, while founder's natural optimism keeps morale high and promotes perseverance, if left unchecked it can lead to underestimating risks and ignoring negative outcomes.

As founders, we need to recognize that in parallel to our startup's journey, our own journey unfolds too — one of self-awareness and maturity. With great power, there comes the need for great adaptability.
