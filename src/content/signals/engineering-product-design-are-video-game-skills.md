Engineering, Product, and Design used to be separate skills, but in the age of AI agents, they are like video game skills. You can clear the early levels by maxing one, but you won’t progress if the other two are at zero.

It’s now normal to see product managers and designers writing code and implementing UI with agents in the loop.

Two examples from the SuperPlane team:

[Aleksandar](https://github.com/AleksandarCole) is a Product Manager. He spends most of his time curating the product not by writing tiny issues for engineers but by acting as a full-stack developer, writing code to build new features or tweak the existing ones. He's also orchestrating agents to create issues based on product requirements, review pull requests, and generate new ideas.

[Petar](https://github.com/ropsii) is a UI/UX Designer. He's creating the UI/UX for the app and implementing behaviors that he wants to see in the app as a full-fledged frontend developer. Since picking up Cursor, he has not opened Figma.

AI makes leveling up universally available, and it raises the bar for what's considered good enough. Depth still matters, but range is how you stay effective.
