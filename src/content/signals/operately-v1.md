Today we're releasing Operately 1.0. Most open source products have a bad UX. At Operately we have set a higher standard.

For example, the Work Map is our third design solution for visualizing goals and projects. Sometimes you need a few bad takes before you nail it.

Would love to hear your thoughts if you're looking to replace duct-taped Notion documents or legacy project management tools at your company. Drop me a DM on any of the socials linked below with any feedback or ideas as you try it out.

This is just the beginning. The best is yet to come.
