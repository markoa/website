Common sense is most objective. We, on the other hand, get carried away easily. The depths of our ego, desires and passions lead us to believe that we need to implement features to serve thousands of customers on day one, treat employees as children and overrreact with ASAP notices.

> Easy is a word that's used to describe other people's jobs.

That's why we need something to periodically reiterate common sense for us. But it's not only about correcting mistakes and reassurance of what matters in a company. This book is a catalyst, and after reading it I am even more excited about my work as my ideas are augmented with a realization that I can simplify even more.
