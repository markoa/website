It's easy to proclaim focus, but it's a whole other game to practice the sheer discipline of seeing things through when your big customer cancels, your head of engineering leaves, the backlog gets boring, and the next shiny idea comes knocking while you're trying to execute a multi-month strategy.

Kudos to Cedric for addressing what many of us avoid: how deeply distractions and forgetfulness affect our work, despite it seeming unprofessional to admit.

The whole Commoncog website feels like a breath of fresh air in the world of fluffy business writing.
